Program should work like...

#welcomes user
"Welcome to Recipe Rack!"
#presents user with options & asks for input
"What would you like the main of your meal to be? Enter 1-7:"
"1.Vegan 2.Vegetarian 3.Chicken 4.Beef 5.Pork 6.Fish 7.Random"
#takes user input and returns the names of recent recipes, as pulled from API
"1.Recipe Name 1 2. Recipe name 2, etc"
#asks user for which recipe they would like and gives them more options
"Recipe Name:
 Recipe Cook Time:
 Recipe Ingredients:
 Recipe Link:"

 What tests should we have?
 1. Greets the user
 2. Gives user options
 3. Reprompts options when user enters < 1 or > 7
 4. Recipes only from the last 3 days
 5. Chicken does not return fish, etc
 6. has an exit options
